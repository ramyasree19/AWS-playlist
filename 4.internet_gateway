So far we discussed:
 ✔️ VPC
 ✔️ Subnetting
 ✔️ Route Tables
🚀Today’s concept: Internet Gateway (IGW)

🔹 First, Important Understanding
When we create a VPC & Subnets 
👉 By default, every subnet is private.
That means:
 Instances inside the subnet cannot directly access the internet.
To make a subnet public, we use an Internet Gateway (IGW).

🔹 What is an Internet Gateway?
An Internet Gateway (IGW) is a horizontally scaled, highly available AWS-managed component that:
- Enables communication between VPC and the Internet
- Performs 1:1 NAT for public IP addresses (will talk about NAT later)
- Allows inbound and outbound internet traffic
💡 Think of it as the bridge between your VPC and the public internet.

🔹 Important Rule
✔️ One VPC can have only one IGW attached at a time
✔️ One IGW can be attached to only one VPC at a time

🔹 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1️⃣ Create an Internet Gateway
2️⃣ Attach the IGW to the VPC
3️⃣ Create a custom Route Table for public subnets
4️⃣ Edit routes inside the Route Table, Add default route pointing to IGW i.e 
👉 If traffic does not match any specific CIDR block, send it to the Internet Gateway.
5️⃣ Associate the public subnet with this route table
Now the subnet becomes a public subnet.

🔹 Very Important: Public IP Requirement
Resources created inside that subnet:
1️⃣ By default, instances get a private IP address
2️⃣ To access the internet, they must have a public IP address
Make sure:
✔️ “Auto-assign Public IPv4” is enabled
 OR
✔️ Assign an Elastic IP manually
Because:
👉 Using only a private IP, instances cannot communicate with the internet via IGW.


The resources doesn't have any idea about the public IP 

users----> public IP ------> private IP ------> Resources
             | it will translate to | it checks with |
Public IP is associated with private IP

TL;dR 
- Enable resources to connect to internet
- IGW attach to VPC and a region resilient
- VPC can have only 1 IGW and IGW can only be attached to max 1 VPC
- A sunet is made public once a default route points to IWG in VPC
