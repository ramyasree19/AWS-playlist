# Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - Cloud Fundamentals

I began revising cloud fundamentals, starting with one of the most important networking concepts in AWS — Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). I would to like to share the basics and actual work behind it.

## What is VPC?

A VPC allows you to:
- **Isolate resources** from other resources in the cloud
- Operate within a **specific single region**
- Create an **isolated network environment**
- Maintain **network boundaries**
- **Explicitly control** communication with other resources

---

## VPC Gives You Full Control Over:

- 🌐 **CIDR Block** (range of IP addresses)
- 📊 **Subnetting** (groups of IP addresses)
- 🛣️ **Routing** (route tables)
- 🔥 **Firewalls** (NACLs, Security Groups)
- 🚪 **Gateways** (IGW, NAT)

## 2 Types of VPCs

1. **Default VPC**
2. **Custom VPC** (fully controlled)

## Default VPC - How It Works

### Key Characteristics:

- ✅ **1 Default VPC per region**
- ✅ CIDR block must be between **/16 to /28**
- ✅ **/16 IPv4 CIDR block** → always `172.31.0.0/16` (~65k IP addresses)
- ✅ **/20 Default subnet** in each Availability Zone
- ✅ **IGW (Internet Gateway)** attached to VPC
- ✅ **Default route to IGW** in routing table associated with subnet
- ✅ **Security Groups** to secure resources
- ✅ **Default NACLs** to secure subnets and VPC overall
