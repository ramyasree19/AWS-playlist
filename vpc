I began revising cloud fundamentals, starting with one of the most important networking concepts in AWS — Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). I would to like to share the basics and actual work behind the scenes in AWS

what is VPC?
Isolate resources from other resources in the cloud
- Specific to single region
- Isolated
- Network bounded
- Explicitly allow to communicate with other resources

VPC gives you full control over:
- CIDR Block (range of IP addresses)
- Subnetting ( groups of IP address)
- Routing ( route tables)
- Firewalls ( NACLs, Security Groups)
- Gateways ( IGW, NAT)

2 Types of VPCs
Default VPC & Custom VPC(fully controlled)

Let’s explore the concept of the Default VPC and how a VPC actually works
- 1 Default VPC per region
- In general, CIDR block must be in between /16 to /28
- /16 IPv4 CIDR block, it is always 172.31.0.0/16 i.e ~65k ip addresses
- /20 Default subnet in each availability Zone
- IGW attached to VPC
- Default route to IGW in routing table which is attached/ associated to subnet
- On top this we use Security Groups to secure resources
- Default NACLs, secure subnets and VPC overall
