So far, we covered:
 ✔️ What is a VPC?
 ✔️ VPC Subnetting

let’s continue with:
 👉 Route Tables in a VPC
Because creating subnets is not enough —
 We must decide how traffic moves.

In Amazon VPC, every VPC automatically comes with an implicit virtual router.
This router behaves like a physical router in a data center, but it is fully managed by AWS 

🔹 VPC Router & Interfaces
Each subnet inside a VPC has a router interface at:
👉 The first usable IP address of the subnet (usually x.x.x.1)
Example:
 If subnet CIDR is x.x.x.0/24
Network address → x.x.x.0
Router interface → x.x.x.1
Note: AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in every subnet. (covered in VPC subnets topic)

🔹 Purpose of Routing in a VPC:
1️⃣ Subnets communicate with each other 
2️⃣ Traffic move IN and OUT of the VPC

🔹 Route Table 
A Route Table is a 👉 set of rules (routes) that the VPC router uses to forward traffic.
Destn ----- match ------ point to target 
eg: Packet leaves at subnet, checks for destination IP of packet find the matching route by checking destination 

Each route contains:
Destination → CIDR block to match
Target → Where traffic should go
Example:
Destination Target
x.x.x.0/16 local
default route Internet Gateway

When a packet leaves a subnet:
It checks the destination IP
The router performs longest prefix match
Traffic is forwarded to the matching target

🔹 How It Works (Step-by-Step)
Create a VPC
Create subnets
Create or use a route table
Associate the route table with subnets
Add or edit routes (Destination + Target)

Cloud networking becomes clear when you understand the relationship between:
👉 VPC → Subnet → Route Table → Gateway
